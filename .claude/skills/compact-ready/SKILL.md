# compact-ready

Answer "is now a good time for compaction?" and make it true. A compaction keeps a summary and
drops the rest, so everything a later turn needs must sit in a commit, `NEXT.md`, a plan file or
the summary text before `/compact` runs. Invoke as `/compact-ready`; `/board` runs it at the end of
every render. The board is `../submit.diyaccounting.co.uk/NEXT.md`, and this repository's rows on
it are the ones its own `NEXT.md` pointer names.

## 1. Gather

Read, do not recall:

```bash
git status --short                                  # main checkout
git worktree list
for w in $(git worktree list --porcelain | awk '/^worktree /{print $2}'); do
  echo "== $w"; git -C "$w" status --short; git -C "$w" log --oneline -1
done
gh pr list --state open --json number,headRefName,mergeStateStatus
gh run list --limit 15 --json workflowName,status,headBranch,databaseId \
  --jq '.[]|select(.status!="completed")'
```

Also list this session's running sub-agents, Monitors and background commands, by their labels.

## 2. Settle each item

| Found | Action before compaction |
|---|---|
| A sub-agent mid-edit | Wait for its report, or `SendMessage` it to commit what it has and report; never compact over uncommitted agent work |
| A sub-agent that reported, work not landed | Land it: `git status --short` in its worktree, cherry-pick or copy its own files onto the batch, one commit per row, content proof (`git diff <agent-branch> <batch> -- <files>` empty) |
| Uncommitted changes in a batch worktree or the main checkout | Commit them (own files only) or name them in the summary as deliberately left |
| A board row whose state changed this session | Write it back in `../submit.diyaccounting.co.uk/NEXT.md`: move it to its section, update its remainder, run `npx vitest run app/unit-tests/nextShape.test.js` in that repository, commit, push to its `main` as its own command |
| A decision or fact the operator gave in chat | Write it into its board row, plan file or memory now |
| A merge in progress (`/auto-merge` between gate and verify) | Finish it first |
| A push waiting on a deploy | Leave it waiting; name the branch, the commit and the run it waits on in the summary |
| A Monitor or background command | Keep it: notifications still arrive after a compaction. Name each in the summary with what to do on its events |

## 3. Answer

One line first: `yes`, `yes after <action>`, or `not yet: <what to wait for>`.

`not yet` has exactly two causes, and nothing else earns it:

1. A sub-agent is mid-edit and its work is not committed.
2. A merge is between its gates and its verification.

Everything else is `yes`, with the item named in the summary. That includes a PR in CI, a deploy
running, a push waiting for a deploy, a scheduled or nightly run, an operator's pending yes, a
Monitor or background command, and a sub-agent that has committed but not yet reported. Each of
these goes on waiting unaided, and its notification arrives after the compaction. Waiting for them
before compacting only delays the compaction; it protects nothing. Before writing `not yet`, name
which of the two causes applies; if neither does, the answer is `yes`.

Then the list the summary must keep, because it lives only in this conversation:

1. What is running: each agent, Monitor and background command, and what to do when it reports.
2. The batch's next steps: branch, worktree, the commits on it, what verifies it, the PR.
3. Operator decisions from this session not yet in a file.
4. Operator commands handed over and not yet run, in full with the `!` prefix.

When the answer is `yes`, print one line, `/compact ` followed by the list, in a fenced block, so the
operator runs it as typed; the built-in `/compact` is the operator's to run.
