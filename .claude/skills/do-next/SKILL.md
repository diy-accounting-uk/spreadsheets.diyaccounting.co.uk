# do-next — work `NEXT.md`'s open items with the coordinator model

This skill turns this repo's `NEXT.md` **Open items** section into a dispatched batch of
worktree-isolated sub-agents, keeps `NEXT.md` itself as the live tracking surface while they run,
and lands each one's work the moment it's ready rather than waiting for the whole batch.

This repo's `NEXT.md` points at the workspace root's `../NEXT.md` for the rules governing its own
shape (DONE-or-OPEN only, nothing deferred; a bug found fixing item A is A's remainder, not a new
item; `NEXT.md` holds only what to do next — completed work lives in `git log`). Plans of record
are `PLAN_*.md` files at this repo's root.

> **Invoke it by telling a session:** *"Follow the `do-next` skill"*, or "work the open items in
> NEXT.md", or "do NEXT".

## When to run this

- `NEXT.md`'s **Open items** section has one or more entries and nobody is actively working them.
- A prior batch just landed and items remain — dispatch the next batch rather than stopping (see
  the workspace `CLAUDE.md`'s "an approved plan is authorization" rule).
- The operator asks to "work the backlog", "clear NEXT.md", or names this skill directly.

## Procedure

1. **Read `NEXT.md`'s Open items fresh, don't work from memory of a prior run.** The list changes
   shape every time a batch lands.
2. **Filter before dispatching.** Not every open item is actionable code work. A gotcha note
   documenting something already correct stays in `NEXT.md` as reference; it doesn't get a track.
   Only dispatch items that describe a real, boundable change.
3. **Decompose into tracks with clear file-ownership boundaries.** This repo's natural
   boundaries: `app/products/*.js` (per-product cell mapping and reconciliation logic),
   `app/data/*.toml` (tax rate data, one file per year), `app/templates/**` (xlsx templates),
   `web/spreadsheets.diyaccounting.co.uk/public/**` (site pages), `cdk-spreadsheets/**` (CDK
   infrastructure), `.github/workflows/**` (generation/deploy pipelines). Two tracks that both
   need to touch the same file are a merge-collision risk, not two independent tracks — either
   sequence them or scope each to non-overlapping regions and say so in both briefs.
4. **Pick each track's model tier deliberately**, per the workspace `CLAUDE.md`'s coordinator
   ladder — group tracks needing similar depth so one hard track doesn't price a whole batch at
   the top tier:
   - **Opus** — novel design work: a new reconciliation approach, a decision with real
     architectural weight, anything in a large or subtle pipeline file (`spreadsheet-runner.js`,
     `generate.js`).
   - **Sonnet** — a bounded decision plus mechanical implementation against an existing pattern
     (adding a tax year's TOML data, extending a CELL_MAP, porting a site page pattern).
   - **Haiku** — pure mechanical sweeps: renames, manifest updates, format-only edits.
5. **Write `NEXT.md`'s in-flight tracking block before dispatching**, one line per track naming
   what it covers and its status (`started`). Commit this alone, docs-only — it's the record that
   a batch is running even if the session dispatching it ends before any track lands.
6. **Dispatch each track as an isolated-worktree agent**, self-contained (fresh agents carry no
   conversation context — the brief must stand alone). Every brief needs:
   - Enough project background to work without asking (spreadsheets AWS account, S3 + CloudFront
     static site, Excel workbook pipeline in `packages/` — see this repo's `CLAUDE.md`).
   - The exact file-ownership list — what it owns, what it must not touch and why.
   - **Testing**: `npm test` for the file it touched at minimum; `npm run test:browser` for site
     pages; the relevant `test:*-only` script (`test:bst-only`, `test:se-only`, `test:ltd-only`,
     `test:taxi-only`, `test:reconciliation-only`) for product-module or data changes. No full
     behaviour-test suite (`test:spreadsheetsBehaviour-*`) inside a track — that's the
     coordinator's job at the actual push/deploy moment.
   - **Git discipline**: confirm repo-local identity, commit early and often with clean messages,
     never `git stash`/`reset --hard`/`checkout --`/`clean`, never push, never merge to `main`,
     never edit `NEXT.md` (the coordinator owns it).
   - **For any item whose result is visual** (a site page, a generated PDF guide layout), a
     screenshot the agent actually looks at. Drive the page with Playwright, save a PNG under
     `reports/screenshots/`, **open that PNG with the Read tool**, and describe what it shows
     against what the item asked for.
   - **A report-back contract**: what it implemented and why, any bugs found along the way even
     if unrelated to the task (name file/line), exact test commands run with pass/fail counts,
     screenshot paths if any, and anything deliberately left out of scope and why.
7. **As each track's completion notification arrives**, land it immediately — don't wait for
   siblings:
   - `git status --short` inside the agent's worktree first. Uncommitted work is a real loss if
     skipped.
   - `cd` to the actual repo root and confirm (`pwd`, `git branch --show-current`) before merging.
   - `git merge --no-ff` with a message naming the track and what it covers.
   - Run that track's blast-radius tests on the merged `main`, not just trust the agent's own
     report.
   - Green: `git push`. Then `git worktree remove` and `git branch -d` the merged branch.
   - Red: don't push through it. Diagnose before merging the next track.
8. **Update `NEXT.md` in the same breath as each landing**, not batched at the end. Move the
   track's in-flight line to a landed note (commit SHA, test counts), and remove the item it
   resolved from Open items — but only once nothing that item's own track surfaced is still
   outstanding. Narrow the item's text instead of removing it, if the track only closed part of a
   multi-part item.
   **A bug the track's report surfaces is that item's remainder, not a new item.**
   **A failing test a track reports is an open item and a job for this batch**, whether or not the
   track caused it.
9. **Before a push to `main` or a branch with a remote, run the full suite** (`npm test`, plus
   `npm run test:browser` and the relevant behaviour-test target when the change reaches the site
   or a package) — the one moment the full suite is mandatory, regardless of how narrow every
   track's own testing was.
10. **Loop.** Anything still open — an item no track picked up, a bug logged during landing, a
    track that failed and needs a retry — becomes the next batch. Dispatch it the same way, don't
    stop to ask permission if the operator's own instruction already covers "keep going" for this
    kind of batch.

## What NOT to do

- Don't dispatch a track for an item that's a documentation note, not a task — check first.
- Don't let a sub-agent push, merge to `main`, or edit `NEXT.md` — those are the coordinator's own
  integration work.
- Don't run the full behaviour-test suite inside a sub-agent — the targeted `npm test` /
  `test:*-only` rung replaces it for worktree work.
- Don't batch every track's merge for the end of the session — merge, test, and push each one as
  it lands, so a slow track doesn't hold back four fast ones.
- Don't silently drop a bug a sub-agent surfaces because it's outside the current track's scope —
  track it in `NEXT.md` as a sub-clause of the item that surfaced it.
- Don't leave a merged worktree or its branch behind — remove both in the same breath as the
  merge.
